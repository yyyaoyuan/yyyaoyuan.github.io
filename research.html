<i>Research challenges:<br />
1. How to deal with the non-convex optimization problem formulated for the state estimation? <br />

</b></p>
<p><i>Contributions:</i>
We propose a convexification framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP)
and second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxations to cope
with inherent non-convexity of power flow (PF) and power system state estimation (PSSE) problems.
We study the performance of the proposed framework in the case where the set of measurements
includes: (i) nodal voltage magnitudes, and (ii) branch active
power flows over a spanning tree of the network. <tt>It is shown that the SDP and SOCP relaxations
both recover the true PF solution as long as the voltage angle difference across each
line of the network is not too large. By capitalizing on the result for the PF problem,
penalized SDP and SOCP problems are designed to solve the PSSE.
Strong theoretical results are derived to quantify the optimal solution of
the penalized SDP problem, which is shown to possess a dominant
rank-one component formed by lifting the true voltage vector.</tt>
An upper bound on the estimation error is also derived as a
function of the noise power, which decreases exponentially fast
as the number of measurements increases.</p>

<i>Research challenges:<br />
1. How to handle the inherent uncertainty of renewable energy sources for day-ahead market clearing and power dispatch?<br />
2. How to engage all local controllers in the distributed energy management for microgrids?</i>
</b></p>
<p><i>Contributions:</i> Due to its reduced communication overhead and robustness
to failures, distributed energy management is of paramount
importance in smart grids, especially in microgrids, which
feature distributed generation (DG) and distributed storage (DS).
<tt> To address the intrinsically stochastic availability of renewable energy sources
(RES), a novel power scheduling approach is introduced. The approach
involves the actual renewable energy as well as the energy
traded with the main grid, so that the supply–demand balance is
maintained.</tt> Leveraging the dual decomposition, the optimization
problem formulated is solved in a distributed fashion by
the local controllers of DG, DS, and dispatchable loads. </p>
<p><tt>Capitalizing on the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), the novel day-ahead
stochastic market clearing model is able to mitigate the potentially high risk
of the recourse actions to compensate wind forecast errors.</tt>
The resulting convex optimization task is tackled via a distribution-free sample average
based approximation to bypass the prohibitively complex high-dimensional integration.
Furthermore, to cope with possibly large-scale dispatchable loads, a
fast distributed solver is developed with guaranteed convergence
using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).</p>

<i>Research challenges:<br />
1. How to exploit the valuable spatio-temporal correlations in energy data (electricity prices, load demand, renewable power generation, etc)? <br />
2. How to develop fast and scalable algorithms for massive datasets?</i>
</b></p>
<p><i>Contributions:</i> The smart grid vision entails advanced information
technology and data analytics to enhance the efficiency, sustainability,
and economics of the power grid infrastructure. Aligned
to this end, modern statistical learning tools are leveraged
for electricity market inference. <tt>Day-ahead price forecasting is
cast as a low-rank kernel learning problem. Uniquely exploiting
the market clearing process, congestion patterns are modeled as
rank-one components in the matrix of spatio-temporally varying
prices.</tt> Through a novel nuclear norm-based regularization, kernels
across pricing nodes and hours can be systematically selected.
Even though market-wide forecasting is beneficial from a learning
perspective, it involves processing high-dimensional market data.
The latter becomes possible after devising a block-coordinate descent
algorithm for solving the non-convex optimization problem
involved. The algorithm utilizes results from block-sparse vector
recovery and is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point. </p>

<i>Research challenges:<br />
1. How to design efficient samplers for big data sketching robust to model uncertainties?</i>
</b></p>
<p><i>Abstract:</i> Data reduction for large-scale linear regression is
one of the most important tasks in this era of data deluge.
Exact model information is however not often available for big
data analytics. <tt> We propose a framework for big data
sketching (i.e., a data reduction tool) that is robust to possible
model mismatch. Such a sketching task is cast as a Boolean
min-max optimization problem, and then equivalently reduced
to a Boolean minimization program.</tt> Capitalizing on the block
coordinate descent algorithm, a scalable solver is developed to
yield an efficient sampler and a good estimate of the unknown
regression coefficient.</p>

2. What is the impact of uncertainties of renewable energy on the ahead-of-time and real-time decision making? </i>
</b></p>
<p><i>Contributions:</i> We develop dynamic energy management for smart-grid powered coordinated
multi-point (CoMP) transmissions. To address the intrinsic variability
of renewable energy sources, a novel energy transaction
mechanism is introduced for grid-connected base stations that are
also equipped with an energy storage unit. <tt>Aiming to minimize
the expected energy transaction cost while guaranteeing the
worst-case users’ quality of service, an infinite-horizon optimization
problem is formulated to obtain the optimal downlink
transmit beamformers that are robust to channel uncertainties.</tt>
Capitalizing on the virtual-queue based relaxation technique
and the stochastic dual-subgradient method, an efficient online
algorithm is developed yielding a feasible and asymptotically
optimal solution. </p>
<p>A large number of geo-distributed data centers begin
to surge in the era of data deluge and information explosion.
To meet the growing demand in massive data processing, the
infrastructure of future data centers must be energy-efficient and
sustainable. <tt>Facing this challenge, a systematic framework is put
forth to integrate renewable energy sources (RES),
distributed storage units, cooling facilities, as well as dynamic
pricing into the workload and energy management tasks of a
data center network.</tt> To cope with RES uncertainty, the resource
allocation task is formulated as a robust optimization problem
minimizing the worst-case net cost. </p>

3. How to simultaneously achieve the distributed array and intra-node array gains for a relay network? </i>
</b></p>
<p><i>Abstract:</i> We optimize the design of transmit- and receive-beamformers for
ad hoc CR networks when CR-to-CR channels are known, but CR-to-PU channels cannot be estimated accurately.
<div class="blockcontent">Capitalizing on a norm-bounded channel uncertainty model, the optimal beamforming
design is formulated to minimize the overall mean-square
error (MSE) from all data streams, while enforcing protection
of the PU system when the CR-to-PU channels are uncertain.</div>
Even though the resultant optimization problem is non-convex,
algorithms with provable convergence to stationary points are
developed by resorting to block coordinate ascent iterations,
along with suitable convex approximation techniques. Enticingly,
the novel schemes also lend themselves naturally to distributed
implementations. </p>
