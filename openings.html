<h2>About UC Santa Cruz</h2>
<p>The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) is a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>R1 research university</a> and one of 10 campuses in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>University of California system</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y96pamy6" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>The campus</a> lies on 2,000 acres of forested hills overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Monterey Bay. It is located 75 miles south of San Francisco, and just over the coastal mountains from Silicon Valley. Getting here is easy since several major highways run to Santa Cruz, and the San Francisco, San Jose, and Monterey airports are all nearby.</p>
<p>Founded in 1965, UCSC began as â€œthe most significant educational experiment in the history of the University of California." Since then, it has evolved into a modern research university with a wide variety of both undergraduate and graduate programs. The Baskin School of Engineering includes departments of Applied Mathematics, Biomolecular Engineering, Computational Media, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Statistics.  At our school, a close interrelationship exists among all departments, and with the other divisions of UC Santa Cruz. A collegial atmosphere encourages cooperative interaction as School of Engineering faculty and students carry out joint research projects with faculty of other divisions and with other universities as well as industry and government research laboratories. A commitment to academic excellence with a focus on engineering for social good gives meaning to our work and provides a that all of our faculty, staff, and students share. </p>
